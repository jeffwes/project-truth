      "title": "MORAL FOUNDATIONS THEORY - COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK",
      "intro": "Moral Foundations Theory (Jonathan Haidt) identifies six innate psychological systems that shape moral judgment across cultures. These \"foundations\" are like taste receptors—everyone has them, but political tribes differ dramatically in which foundations they weight most heavily. Understanding which foundations a piece of content activates reveals its tribal targeting and persuasive strategy.",

        "Progressives rely heavily on Care and Fairness, with lower emphasis on Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity. This makes progressive messaging focused on suffering reduction and equality.",
        "Conservatives weight all six foundations more evenly, with especially high Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity. This makes conservative messaging emphasize tradition, order, and group cohesion.",
        "Libertarians spike on Liberty/Oppression and downplay Authority, making them suspicious of both government power and social conformity pressure.",
        "Most political conflict stems from tribes talking past each other because they're activating different moral foundations. What progressives see as compassion (high Care), conservatives may see as naive bleeding-heart sentimentality that ignores group boundaries (low Loyalty) and proper order (low Authority)."
